# Object-Oriented-Final
Place to show I did version control on the final project
========================================================
While in the proposal for this project I had plans for this to be a random encounter, my time constriants did not allow me to do this.
Instead this is a part of the whole idea. This is the dialogue system without the random aspect. Over time, a random system could be made, I just don't have the time to flesh out enough dialogue to make a fully random system.
This project is an idea based on the dialogue systems from games made by Bethesda like Fallout and The Elder Scrolls.
As test dialogue, I used the meeting with the Vault-Tec Rep at the begining of Fallout 4 as my base dialogue, since it is good at showing each option.
