# Object-Oriented-Final
Place to show I did version control on the final project
========================================================
While in the proposal for this project I had plans for this to be a random encounter, my time constriants did not allow me to do this.
Instead this is a part of the whole idea. This is the dialouge system without the random aspect. Over time, a random system could be made.
This project is an idea based on the dialouge systems from games made by Bethesda like Fallout and The Elder Scrolls.
As test dialouge, I used the meeting with the Vault-Tec Rep at the begining of Fallout 4 as my base dialouge, since it is good at showing each option.
